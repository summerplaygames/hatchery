# hatchery

This project is currently in the **development** phase and **is not yet usable**.

Hatchery is a mock DragonChain transaction API. It's intended to be used for quickly (and freely) testing and iterating on DragonChain smart contracts. It uses an in-memory ledger and an embedded BoltDB store for smart contract heap. A filesystem-based smart contract library is provided and smart contracts can be posted to Hatchery using a REST API compatible with DragonChain's.

SummerPlay will use Hatchery for testing and iterating on DragonChain smart contracts for its games, and as such, development priority will be given to features that these games use. If there's a feature that Hatchery is missing and you'd like to see it included, feel free to submit a PR for review.
